       Windows CE APPLICATION : webcdemo_pocket_pc
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this webcdemo_pocket_pc application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your webcdemo_pocket_pc application.

webcdemo_pocket_pc.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

webcdemo_pocket_pc.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h).

webcdemo_pocket_pc.vcp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.vcp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

AppWizard has created the following resources:

webcdemo_pocket_pc.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows CE resources that the
    program uses.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	eMbedded Visual C++.

webcdemo_pocket_pc.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file webcdemo_pocket_pc.rc.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named webcdemo_pocket_pc.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

Newres.h
    This header file is used to replace the ..\mfc\include\afxres.h.
