webc has a url type called webc:, which can also be accessed as rom:. This url type acts just like the file: url type except the content is compiled into the webC library as constant data. <br>
A convenient way to develop applications is to simulate your application on Windows with webC using the Windows file system, populaying a Windows subtree with images, html files , style sheets and javascript source files.<br>
When you want to use the content on your embedded device you can create a webC rom file system image from the disk content with a single command.<br>

<P>makewebcfs Converts an entire Windows subdirectory and its children into a set of 'C' declarations. These declarations are embedded in header files which you then include into your application code. You then make a call to wcAddFsTree() to add this subtree to the rom file system structure.
Once a table is added to the webc: file system it may be accessed with the webc: url. (see below for an example).<br>

<BR><B>-n</B> - =filenamebase (optional) Base of the two output files to produce, "basenamefiletable.h" and "basenamefiledata.h". If not specified webcfiletable.h and webcfiledata.h are created.

<PRE>
To convert a file system subtree to a webc: subtree you must follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Open a DOS box.</li>
<li>For convenience change directory (CD) to the location of your project</li>
<li>Run <!1><A HREF="makewebcfs.html">makewebcfs</A> to create include files you will need.</li>
<li>Edit one of your aplication files file to include the two header files created by makewebcfs.</li>
<li>Edit the file and insert a call to <!1><A HREF="wcAddFsTree.html">wcAddFsTree</A>() to insert the subdirectory tree into the webc: file system.</li>
<ul>
For example:
<br>Suppose you have a webc project located at \MyExampleProject and you have been experimenting using content in a Windows subdirectory named \MyContent. You have been accessing it with file: based urls
but now you want to build the content into your embedded applications rom image and have it be accessible from the webc: file system.<br>
<ul>
<li>Open a DOS box.</li>
<li>type CD \MyExampleProject</li>
<li>type <!1><A HREF="makewebcfs.html">makewebcfs</A> -n=Examples \MyContent</li>
<li><i> You could also have typed:</i> <!1><A HREF="makewebcfs.html">makewebcfs</A> -n=Examples -o=\MyExampleProject \MyContent</li>
<li>Edit your startup file and add these two lines:<br>
#include "Examplesfiletable.h" <br>
#include "Examplesfiledata.h" <br>
</li>
<li>Add this call to your code <b><!1><A HREF="wcAddFsTree.html">wcAddFsTree</A>(Examples);</b></li>
</ul>
To illustrate:
&nbsp;If you have a subdirectory populated like this on the Windows workstation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;\MyContent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File.css
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Images
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image1.gif<br>
It will be acessible from webc: on the Windows workstation as.
&nbsp;file:///MyContent/File.html
&nbsp;file:///MyContent/File.css
&nbsp;file:///MyContent/Images/Images.gif<br>
But after successfully executing(<!1><A HREF="makewebcfs.html">makewebcfs</A> -n=Examples \MyContent) the files will be accesible from these webc: urls.
&nbsp;webc://File.html
&nbsp;webc://File.css
&nbsp;webc://Images/Images.gif<br>
The files are also accesible from these rom: urls.
&nbsp;rom://File.html
&nbsp;rom://File.css
&nbsp;rom://Images/Images.gif<br>
Note: If you want them to be accessible as:
&nbsp;webc:/MyContent/File.html
&nbsp;webc:/MyContent/File.css
&nbsp;webc:/MyContent/Images/Images.gif
and.
&nbsp;rom:/MyContent/File.html
&nbsp;rom:/MyContent/File.css
&nbsp;rom:/MyContent/Images/Images.gif
You must have the the foldernametoconvert argument point to a parent folder that contains just the one folder named MyContent.
