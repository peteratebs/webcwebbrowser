<li>        Configuring webC.</li>
<ul>
<li>webC's feature set and some of its appearance may be changed by editing constants in include/util/webcfg.h.</li>
<li>Default setting for webC display  elements are controlled by a default table maintained in source code file source/util/webcdefault.cpp. </li>
<li>Consult the appendices for more details on configuring webC.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<P><ul>
<li>Application development with webC.</li>
<ul>
<li>Applications may use Javascript or a combination of Javascript and C or they may be developed in pure C with Javascript disabled.</li>
<li>Two groups of API calls are available to C programmers.</li>
<li>The "wc", provides a C interface to many of webC's C++ methods and maintains a context mimicing Javascript in some ways and providing an application development framework.</li>
<li>The "webc_" API is a lower level interface providing additional access to webC's C++ methods. If an API feature is not available through the "wc" interface it may be avaiable through the "webc_" interface. </li>
<li>This section contains an overview on both the "wc" and "webc_" API's.</li>
<li>Later sections contains details on each of the interfaces and example code.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<P><ul>
<li>Using the "wc" interface.</li>
<ul>
<li>The "wc" API provides a C application development framework for webC. The style of the wc interface should be familiar to Javascript programmers. All function names start with the letters "wc", followed by the
type of object the function works on, including "wcEl", "wcDoc", "wcSys", "wcDom", "wcWin". Subsequant characters in the function name describe the functionality.</li>
<li>Examples include:</li>
<ul>
<li>wcElSetEventHandler() - Assign an event handler to a specific element.</li>
<li>wcDocEnumerate() -  Call a user prescribed function once for each element in a document.</li>
<li>wcWinCreateEx() - Create and position a new window, optionally load initial content and attach event handlers.</li>
</ul>

<P>
<li>The "wc" API provides these features:</li>

<P><ul>
<li>            Context management</li>
<ul>
<li>                All API cals require a user context, these are created on entry to an event handler and is destroyed on exit.</li>
<li>                The user context helps manage heap space used to pass information between the webC core, typically ASCII representations of strings that are stored internally as unicode.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Windowing API</li>
<ul>
<li>                Windowing system with support for create, move, save under, destroy. </li>
<li>                Load content from file rom or http or dynamically create content.</li>
<li>                Supports z-order. </li>
<li>                Supports modal dialogues. </li>
<li>                Dynamicaly Create, modify, insert, and delete elements in a document.</li>
<li>                Save under and modal support simplify dialog box coding.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Support for complex composite application objects.</li>
<ul>
<li>                Dynamicaly push and pop user local data to elements, documents or windows.</li>
<li>                Dynamicaly push and pop user local event handlers to elements or documents.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Element and DOM support.</li>
<ul>
<li>                Create, insert, append remove, delete elements in a document.</li>
<li>                Attach and release event handlers and private data sets.</li>
<li>                Get and set styles and other attributes.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Search and document enumeration support.</li>
<ul>
<li>                Top down dom search with XML search strings.</li>
<li>                Simplified document enumeration support with user supplied callbacks.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Metatag API</li>
<ul>
<li>                Mechanism for calling 'C' subroutines when web pages containing specific metatags are loaded.</li>
<li>                Supports native application and device code that is callable from web pages and thus controlled from the server side.</li>
</ul>
<li>            Sytem level utilities to help application development.</li>
<ul>
<li>                A new timer callback model simplifies including user timer callback functions that are not associated with a document or element.</li>
</ul>
<li>        Please review the manual pages for more details on the API.</li>
<li>        A sample application wcapiexamples.cpp is provided with documented code fragments that demonstrate how to use the API. Documentation for the example code in this documentation set.</li>
