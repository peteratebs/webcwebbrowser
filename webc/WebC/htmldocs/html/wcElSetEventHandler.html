<BLOCKQUOTE>Assign an event handler for this element. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="DOC.DOCU"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Documentation</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Push the previous event handler for this element on an internal stack and then
set a new handler for events targetted at the specified element.
The previous event handler may be restored later by calling wcElpopEventHandler.

<P>Note: wcElSetEventHandler pushes the previous handler onto an internal stack. You must call
wcElPopEventHandler at a later time if your application requires you to restore the previous handler when the current algorith is completed.
Most applications don't need a stack more than one level deep but more complex interfaces like drag and drop and slide under windows use this capability.

<DL><DT><DT><B>Parameters:</B><DD><B>wcEL</B> -           		Element       -   The element.
<BR><B>wcEventCallback</B> -  	cb			  -   Function to call for when an event occur.
<PRE>
The callback function is of type:
typedef HTMLEventStatus (*wcEventCallback) (wcCtx* Ctx,	wcEL element, HTMLEvent* event,	char* param);
where Ctx and Element are as in other documented routines.
param is typically unused.
See below for a description of event types and the event structure.
Example: see <!1><A HREF="ExElEventHandling.html">ExElEventHandling</A>
=================================================================
The following events are reported along with user assignable event.
HTML_EVENT_CLICK               Single mouse click
HTML_EVENT_DBLCLICK            Double mouse click
HTML_EVENT_KEYDOWN             Key pressed
HTML_EVENT_KEYPRESS            Key pressed and released
HTML_EVENT_KEYUP               Key released
HTML_EVENT_MOUSEDOWN           Mouse button pressed
HTML_EVENT_MOUSEMOVE           Mouse movement over this object
HTML_EVENT_MOUSEOUT            Mouse pointer exits the client area of this object
HTML_EVENT_MOUSEOVER           Mouse pointer enters the client area
HTML_EVENT_MOUSEUP             Mouse button released
HTML_EVENT_FOCUS               Object has received input focus
HTML_EVENT_UNFOCUS             Object will lose input focus
HTML_EVENT_LOAD                Load completes
HTML_EVENT_UNLOAD              Object is discarded
HTML_EVENT_SUBMIT              For forms only; submit is pressed
HTML_EVENT_CHANGE              Input text was edited
HTML_EVENT_EDIT                Finished Editing on a Textbox
HTML_EVENT_RESET               For forms only; reset is pressed
HTML_EVENT_OBJECT_CREATED       HTMLElement object created
HTML_EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROYED     HTMLElement object destroyed
HTML_EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_PARSED     Attribute parsed
HTML_EVENT_LOSECAPTURE          Mouse capture released
HTML_EVENT_ONREADYSTATECHANGE   Ajax event (XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange event) not implemented
HTML_EVENT_TIMER                A timer message sent by user code via wcQueueEventTimed
HTML_EVENT_RENDER	            A notification message send by the display processing loop about the element. Useful for doing things like retrieveing an element's screen position after it was automatically placed in non fixed formatted
content.
HTML_FIRST_USER_EVENT           This and higher event numbers are available for application programming.
Event handlers must return one of the following:
HTML_EVENT_STATUS_DONE       Handling of this event is complete don't pass it to parent handlers.
HTML_EVENT_STATUS_CONTINUE   Pass the event to parent handler listers and perform any default processing.
HTML_EVENT_STATUS_HALT       Cancel processing operation. Examples include refusing to give up focus and cancel mouse processing.
HTML_EVENT_STATUS_ERROR
The event structure has the following fields.
struct s_HTMLEvent
{
HTMLEventType type;
union
{
struct
{
long x;
long y;
} position;
struct
{
const WEBC_CHAR* name;
const WEBC_CHAR* value;
} attribute;
struct
{
enum NotifierType Notifier;
enum NotifyEventType NotifyEvent;
} NotifyMessage;
WebKey         key;
WEBC_CHAR*     string;
unsigned char* buffer;
} data;
HELEMENT_HANDLE elem;
HELEMENT_HANDLE target;
HELEMENT_HANDLE srcElement;
WEBC_UINT8 flags;                 see flag definitions below
int returnValue;
};
Event flags that may be set by handlers to control processing as with the return codes.
The return codes are more often used by Javascript but they can be used for C event dispatchers as well.
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_CANCEL_BUBBLE    - These flags values may be set by handlers to
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_CANCEL_DEFAULT   - control processing as with the return codes.
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_CANCEL_SET_FOCUS - Javascript events use these flags too.
Keyboard metakey states are provided on mouse events an key events.
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_SHIFT_DOWN       - Keyboard metakey states provided on mouse event or keypress.
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_CTRL_DOWN        -
HTML_EVENT_FLAG_ALT_DOWN         -
