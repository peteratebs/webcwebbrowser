<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Release resources associated with a webC context that was initialized by an earlier call to wctxtInit.
The resources that accumulate in the context block are mainly string buffers used to return data that has
been converted from internal unicode form to Ascii.

<P><PRE>
         Note: It is usually unnecessary to call wcCtxtRelease because most Event handlers, those that were hooked with wcElSetEventHandler,
         because the event dispatch code automatically calls wcCtxtRelease after the user's callback function returns.
        handler returns.

<P>        Note: wcCtxtRelease may be called multiple times, even in a routine that was passed a context structure and did not even call wcCtxtInit().
        Each wcCtxtRelease is called it frees all accumulated return buffers, typically this can wait until an event handler returns but if a handler
		is performing many many calls to the API in a loop it can force a garbage collect by calling wcCtxtRelease.
