<P>The data is not used by WebC. Typical use of private data is to associate
application specific data with the window when it is created, perhaps at start-up
and to attach element specific data to screen objects as screens are loaded and created.
Event handlers can then access this data and perform application specific operations based on
their contents and perform updates on their contents.

<P>Note: wcPushData places the argument onto an internal stack. You must call wcGetData to access the private data pointer that was
last pushed. When you are done using the data pointer stack you may pop your value and expose the previous private data pointer by
calling wcPopData. Most applications don't need a stack more than one level deep but more complex interfaces involving drag and drop, slide under windows use this capability.
