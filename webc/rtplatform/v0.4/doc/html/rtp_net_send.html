<BLOCKQUOTE>This function is used to send data over a connected 
socket. The socket must be a stream-type (TCP) socket; behavior 
is undefined if sockHandle is not a valid stream-type socket.<br><br>

<P>If the socket is in blocking mode, it returns after all the 
data has been sent and acknowledged by the remote host.  If the 
socket is in non-blocking mode, as much data as possible is 
queued in the output window and as much data as possible is 
sent according to the remote hosts window size and the mss.  
The function then returns.  If there is no room in the output 
window, the function returns an error that may be non-fatal.  
If the socket is in non-blocking mode, select may be called 
to wait for any room in the output window.<br><br>

<P>In non-blocking mode, successful completion of the 
rtp_net_send() indicates that all data is queued in the 
output window.  Call rtp_net_write_select to receive 
notification when the data was sent and acknowledged.<br><br>

<P>In blocking mode, successful completion of the rtp_net_send 
indicates that all data has been received by the remote host.

<DL><DT><DT><B>Parameters:</B><DD><B>sockHandle</B> -   The socket handle to send over. 
<BR><B>buffer</B> -   Pointer to the data to be sent. 
<BR><B>size</B> -   The number of unsigned chars (bytes) to send. <BR><DT><B>Returns:</B><DD>  The number of unsigned chars (bytes) sent if successful, 
-1 on error, -2 if a non-fatal error occurred.  A non-fatal error 
includes a socket that is set for non-blocking mode and the 
native send operation returns immediately with an error 
indicating that it would block or that the operation is in 
progress.  If the application making use of rtp_net_send is 
using non-blocking sockets, it is advised that the return value 
is checked for -2 and continues, using rtp_net_write_select to 
determine if the send operation has been completed before making 
other RTPlatform Socket API calls on this socket.  For debugging 
purposes; if the cause of the error is obtainable at the native 
TCP/IP layer, turn on RTP_DEBUG in rtpdebug.h to display 
the native error value.
