<A NAME="DOC.DOCU"></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>EBSnet's RTPlatform-enabled products all require a certain subset of the 
total services provided by the RTPlatform library.  For each product, it is
necessary to determine the modules required to provide the necessary services to 
that product.  (For example, FTP may require rtpnet for networking, 
rtpfile for file system access, rtpdate for date management, and rtpsignl/rtpthrd
for multi-threaded operation.)

<P>The first step in the porting process is to create a new build environment,
i.e. a new makefile or project file, for the new target.  All the product's "core"
files (the ones in the product's example project file that do not begin with
"rtp", and thus are not a part of RTPlatform) should be added to the new
makefile/project file.  

<P>The next step in porting an RTPlatform-enabled product to a new environment is
to identify the list of RTPlatform modules required by that product.  Once this has
been done, this list can be separated into those modules which have generic, portable
implementations (and thus do not need to be modified in order to support a new 
environment), and those which are specific to a particular OS, CPU, software library,
etc.  The generic RTPlatform modules are located in the RTPlatform install directory
under "source/generic".  These files should be added into the makefile/project file
"as is".

<P>Once this is complete, environment-specific versions of the non-portable modules must 
be added into the build environment.  One should first refer to "source/" to see if 
a compatible version of the required module(s) is already available as part of the 
current RTPlatform distribution.  Those modules that are already ported should be added 
to the build environment.  The remaining modules must be ported manually to the new 
target.  

<P>To port an RTPlatform module to a new target, first locate the template version of 
that module under "source/template".  Create a new directory inside "source/" for the 
new target and copy the template version into this directory; this is the copy of the 
file that you will modify to implement the required functionality in your target 
environment.  Each template file has documentation in the comments above each function 
that describes what the function should do.  

<P><b>NOTE: <i>The header files are compiler specific (rather than target specific). 
If it is desired to make use of these header files to obtain native implementations 
of the modules, it is advised to first build with the generic implementations so 
not to run into any type and/or naming conflicts. Then attempt to build using the 
native version.  If any problems arise and persist, revert to the EBSnet generic 
implementation.  A number of compilers have poor implementations of these standard 
functions, and type and naming conflicts can occure if a project permits native header 
inclusion through to the core modules instead of segregating them to the RTPlatform 
source files.</pre></i></b></BLOCKQUOTE>
